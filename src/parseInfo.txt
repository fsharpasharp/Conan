If the parser is unable to parse an inputted formula, the row will turn red.

Inputted formulas are interpreted as follows:
Predicates use upper-case letters for identifiers, terms use lower-case.
Objects can be indexed, so x0 or a17 are valid objects.

Precedence: 
Unary binds most strongly: ¬,∀,∃
Conjunction/Disjunction comes second: ∧,∨
Implication binds weakest: →

Associativity:
∧ and ∨ are both left-associative, → is right associative

Whitespace is ignored by the parser so it can be freely used for readability.

Examples:
∀x P(x) ∧ Q(x)  would be parsed as: (∀x P(x)) ∧ Q(x) 
A ∨ B ∧ C  would be parsed as: (A ∨ B) ∧ C
A → B → C  would be parsed as: (A → (B → C))
A → B → C ∧ D would be parsed as: A → ((B ∧ C) → D)
